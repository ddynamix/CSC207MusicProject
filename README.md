# CSC207MusicProject
Our music and gig based social media platform developed for CSC207 Summer 2024

To run this project please build using maven after cloning, and run Main.main().
A splash screen will open on your desktop.

We are working on testing a database implementation for our data persistance, and including posting functionality for users of all types. 
Namely, for audienceUsers to create posts, and for artistUsers and venueUsers to create events for promotion. We are also implementing the ability for users to follow eachother, and be able to navigate through various profiles, as well as implementing a more fleshed out UI.
